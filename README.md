# 📊 CGPA Calculator (C++)

A simple C++ program to calculate **SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)** and **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)** based on user input.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Takes **multiple semesters** and **subject-wise grades & credits**  
✅ Computes **SGPA** per semester using weighted grade points  
✅ Calculates **CGPA using total weighted credits**  
✅ **Error handling** to prevent invalid calculations  

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CGPA-Calculator.git
